# linkr

`linkr` is a simple bookmark manager for organizing URLs into collections for safekeeping.

It is built with:

- Next.js
- `shadcn/ui`
- DrizzleORM
- Supabase

## Why?

I used to pay a subcription for a cross-platform bookmark manager like a chump. `linkr` is my own customizable, self-hostable manager that has what I need, lacks what I don't need, and doesn't cost me anything.
